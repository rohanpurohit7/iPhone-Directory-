# iPhone-Directory-
This is a simple phone directory. 
You can add contacts,revise contacts and search for these contacts. 



/*Note that the searchForContact method relies on the onFile method which relies on  findContact method. The findContact method only returns the index of a String term in the ArrayList that exactly matches the searchItem phrase. So the search feature will not return any entries if you have typos or do not specify the full string(name+number) of your phrase.
